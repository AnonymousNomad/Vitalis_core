Neuro-Synth Engine (NSE)

​Sovereign Intelligence | Edge-Native | Autonomous Learning
​The Neuro-Synth Engine (NSE) is the core technology of Ferrell Synthetic Intelligence (FSI). It is a sovereign, offline-first, fluidic intelligence architecture designed to reclaim cognitive autonomy from centralized, corporate-controlled black boxes.
​

🏛️ The FSI Manifesto
​
The future of synthetic intelligence belongs to those who build, own, and defend their own cognitive infrastructure. NSE is not a service; it is a foundation.

​Sovereignty: Zero-dependency, air-gapped capability.

Fluidic Intelligence: Unlike static transformer models, the NSE utilizes a Fluidic Memory Manifold (FMM) that allows for continuous, real-time learning without expensive re-training.

Architecture as Ethics: By prioritizing local performance, we ensure your cognitive chain remains unbroken by third-party intervention.


​🧠 Architectural Overview: The Tri-Head Topology
​The NSE deviates from monolithic transformer stacks by utilizing an asynchronous triad of processing nodes, synchronized via a shared memory ledger.

Dynamic-Gate-Attention (DGA)


​Traditional models suffer from O(n^2) computational complexity. The NSE utilizes DGA, a gated attention mechanism that prunes irrelevant informational paths in real-time, reducing complexity to near-linear scaling for edge-native deployment.
​

The DGA Mathematical Core:


DGA(Q, K, V) = \sigma(\gamma \cdot [Q, K]) \odot \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)VWhere \gamma is the stability-gate managed by the Cor node.)


​🛠️ Installation & Setup
​
The NSE is optimized for Linux environments (specifically ARM64/aarch64).
​Prerequisites
​OS: Linux (Kernel 6.1+)
​Runtime: Python 3.13+

​Dependencies: torch, sentence-transformers, numpy

​Quick Start# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://huggingface.co/your-username/nse-core
cd nse-core

# 2. Setup the environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Initialize the Engine
python3 main.py --mode=init


⚖️ The Fluidic Memory Manifold (FMM)
​Memory in NSE is not a frozen weight set; it is the Geometric State of the Weight Manifold (M_w).
​Self-Verification Protocol (SVP): Before any weight is updated, the engine runs a shadow-simulation to ensure the new information maintains system equilibrium.
​Autonomic Adaptation: The Cor node continuously monitors the variational free energy \mathcal{F}. If entropy spikes, the model triggers an autonomous weight re-calibration, effectively "thinking" its way to stability.
​

🛡️ Operational Integrity
​No Telemetry: The model contains zero hooks for external data leakage.
​Efficiency: Designed for minimal thermal footprint on mobile/tablet ARM64 architectures.
​Customization: Through the Fluidic Substrate, the model specializes in domain-specific tasks simply by ingesting targeted data—without requiring massive GPU clusters.
